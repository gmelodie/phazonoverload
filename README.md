## A Bit About Me

💼  I'm a Developer Advocate at [Vonage](https://developer.nexmo.com/), where I support developers discover, understand and build using our APIs. My focus is supporting developers in London (and, more broadly, EMEA).
- I write [technical blog posts](https://www.nexmo.com/blog/author/kevinlewis).
- I used to host a fortnightly coding stream aimed at beginners called [No Experience Required](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWYngsniPr_nFzSHFNPzb715BP0pa0BQW), but now have a show called Build a Thing where we build a project together over several weeks - you can watch it on the [VonageDevs](https://twitch.tv/vonagedevs) Twitch.
- I work on our champions program - [Vonage Voyagers](https://developer.nexmo.com/voyagers).
- I support community event organizers take [their events online](https://www.nexmo.com/blog/2020/04/08/supporting-communities-to-go-online).
- I also run some internal programmes such as our hackathon series OneHack and the educational activity that surrounds it. 

💖 I'm an experienced event organizer
- I'm lead organizer and coordinator for [You Got This](https://yougotthis.io) - a network of community-run conferences on non-technical 'core' skills.
- I'm an organizer of [London Node User Group](https://lnug.org), [London CSS](https://www.londoncss.dev/) and [BarCamp London](https://barcamplondon.org).

👨‍💻 I primarily write JavaScript, with a further interest in Serverless, Vue.js (with Nuxt.js) and Airtable.

📧 I write a newsletter called [event.Handler()](https://handler.events) which is all about running awesome developer events. We're also turning it into a podcast!

🎲 I love boardgames! [My collection is here.](https://lws.io/games)
